## About

This is a personal project created to practice **web development** and **API integration** skills.  

The project’s main focus is a **Telegram bot**, designed with a modular command system that makes it easy to add new features. Most of the commands are implemented as small **minigames**, showcasing different approaches to bot interaction and command handling.  

A secondary focus is on building a **web application** that works hand-in-hand with the bot. The website serves as an extension of the bot, providing:  
- A more comprehensive **leaderboard**  
- A **suggestion system** where admins can review and approve ideas, which can then be added to the bot’s commands  

Together, the bot and the website form a single, cohesive system.
