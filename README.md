## About

This is a personal project created to practice **web development** and **API integration** skills.  

The projectâ€™s main focus is a **Telegram bot**, designed with a modular command system that makes it easy to add new features. Most of the commands are implemented as small **minigames**, showcasing different approaches to bot interaction and command handling.

Features that bot itself provides are as follows:   
- Includes gambling mini-games (no real money!) â€” compete with others for win streaks.
- Fun commands like **Magic 8 Ball** or **Random Tip** for quick laughs.
- A clever **Pun System** that adds a playful twist to your messages.

A secondary focus is on building a **web application** that works hand-in-hand with the bot. The website serves as an extension of the bot, providing:  
- A more comprehensive **leaderboard**  
- A **suggestion system** where admins can review and approve ideas, which can then be added to the botâ€™s commands  

Together, the bot and the website form a single, cohesive system.
