# cmd

```go
import "github.com/TrueHopolok/VladOS/modules/bot/cmd"
```

All bot commands are handled here. Misspelling is handled by github.com/TrueHopolok/spellchecker/spellchecker.

Command handling is processed in this order:

```
get conversation status
if ( status is active ):
	if msg is cmd{cancel}: reset conversation status
	else: give control to cmd converstation handler
else if ( msg is cmd ):
	if ( msg in list{cmd} ): give control to cmd handler
	else ( if msg is cmd{help} ): output info about commands and bot
 	else: handle that as cmd misspell
else: skip this package and fallthrough to others handlers
```

## Variables

<a name="CommandsList"></a>Stores all commands in the map using initialized variables \(see [Command](<#Command>) type and its variables\).

Few commands are stored and handled seperatly from the list:

- help command since it require accessing this map, which is impossible wihtout cyclic import
- spell checking since it is not a command and happens in case of misspelled command

```go
var CommandsList map[string]map[string]Command = map[string]map[string]Command{
    "Gambling": {
        "bjack": CommandBjack,
        "guess": CommandGuess,
        "slot":  CommandSlot,
        "dice":  CommandDice,
        "stats": CommandStats,
    },
    "Others": {

}
```
